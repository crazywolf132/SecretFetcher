# Security Considerations

## Overview

SecretFetch is designed with security as a top priority. This document outlines our security practices, design decisions, and recommendations for secure usage in enterprise environments.

## Security Features

### 1. Zero Secret Storage
- SecretFetch is a pass-through library that never stores secrets persistently
- In-memory caching is optional and configurable
- Cache entries are automatically cleared after their TTL expires
- Memory is securely zeroed when cache entries are removed

### 2. AWS Integration Security
- Uses official AWS SDK with best practices
- Supports AWS IAM roles and instance profiles
- Compatible with AWS KMS for additional encryption
- No AWS credentials are ever stored in the library
- Supports AWS VPC endpoints for secure internal access

### 3. Access Control
- Follows AWS IAM least-privilege principle
- Supports fine-grained AWS resource policies
- Compatible with AWS Organizations and SCPs
- Works with AWS CloudTrail for audit logging

### 4. Enterprise Compliance
- GDPR-compliant secret handling
- SOC 2 compatible practices
- Supports audit logging
- Zero persistent storage (stateless operation)

## Best Practices

### AWS IAM Configuration

1. Use IAM Roles with minimal permissions:
```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "secretsmanager:GetSecretValue"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:secretsmanager:region:account:secret:prefix/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

2. Enable AWS CloudTrail logging:
```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "cloudtrail:LookupEvents"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Secure Configuration

1. Always use HTTPS when accessing AWS services:
```go
opts := &secretfetch.Options{
    AWS: &aws.Config{
        EndpointResolver: aws.EndpointResolverFunc(func(service, region string) (aws.Endpoint, error) {
            return aws.Endpoint{
                URL:           "https://secretsmanager.region.amazonaws.com",
                SigningRegion: region,
            }, nil
        }),
    },
}
```

2. Configure secure caching:
```go
opts := &secretfetch.Options{
    CacheDuration: 5 * time.Minute,  // Short cache duration
    PreloadARNs: true,              // Preload to reduce API calls
}
```

3. Use pattern validation to prevent injection:
```go
type Config struct {
    // Validate to prevent SQL injection
    DBQuery string `secret:"env=QUERY,pattern=^[a-zA-Z0-9_]+$"`
}
```

## Security Recommendations

### 1. Access Control
- Use AWS IAM roles instead of access keys
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Regularly rotate credentials

### 2. Network Security
- Use AWS PrivateLink/VPC Endpoints
- Enable AWS VPC Flow Logs
- Implement network segmentation
- Use security groups to restrict access

### 3. Monitoring and Auditing
- Enable AWS CloudTrail
- Set up CloudWatch alarms
- Monitor API usage patterns
- Regular security reviews

### 4. Compliance
- Document secret access patterns
- Maintain access logs
- Regular security assessments
- Compliance reporting

## Security Audit Support

SecretFetch supports security auditing through:

1. AWS CloudTrail Integration:
- All AWS Secrets Manager API calls are logged
- Access patterns can be monitored
- Anomaly detection possible

2. Logging Capabilities:
```go
opts := &secretfetch.Options{
    OnSecretAccess: func(ctx context.Context, secretID string) {
        log.Printf("Secret accessed: %s", secretID)
    },
}
```

3. Metrics Collection:
```go
opts := &secretfetch.Options{
    MetricsCollector: &metrics.SecurityMetrics{
        OnSecretAccess: func(metric metrics.SecretAccessMetric) {
            prometheus.SecretAccessCounter.Inc()
        },
    },
}
```

## Security Contacts

For security concerns or to report vulnerabilities:
1. Open a security advisory on GitHub
2. Email: au.brayden.moon@gmail.com
3. Follow our responsible disclosure policy

## Compliance Certifications

While the library itself is not certified, it is designed to be used in certified environments:
- SOC 2
- ISO 27001
- HIPAA
- GDPR
- PCI DSS
